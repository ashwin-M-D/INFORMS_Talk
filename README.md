# INFORMS_Talk

To setup the environment which I have used, you need to have anaconda installed on your system.

With that, download the environment.yml file and run the following in your terminal

```
conda env create -f environment.yml 
```

This will create an environment named as 'informs'. This environment has all the packages needed to run the scripts.
